# Flow-Forwarding
The aim of this assignment is to implement forward flows of packets. Communication is achieved between
an ”employee” and a ”deployment server” by including the destination address in the packet header. The
packet is then sent sent through a series of ”forwarders” which consult a ”controller” to determine where
the next hop is.
